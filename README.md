Simulates and trains a reinforcement learning agent to chase a moving target under different observation/tracking strategies with the aim of catching the target.
Comparisons are made to untrained/stationary strategies. 

## Features

- Brownian motion, LÃ©vy walk, and other dynamic targets
- Discrete observations
