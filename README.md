Simulates and trains a reinforcement learning agent to track a moving target under different observation strategies with the aim of catching the target.
Comparisons are made to untrained/stationary strategies. 

## Features

- Brownian motion + LÃ©vy walk targets
- Discrete observations
- Reinforcement Learning environment (OpenAI Gym API)
- PPO training (via Stable-Baselines3)
- GIF visualizations
